A 3D Barchart written in Java Swing.

It displays a barchart with 3D effect and drawn background. It is created in Java Swing you 
can add it as a JComponent to an existing gui in Java or you can include it into your website as an Applet.

I have included some sample php code with the required dependencies. Should work if you copy 
everything from the project folder to your server.

Any questions, feel free to post.

More to come...

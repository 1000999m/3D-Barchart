A 3D Barchart written in Java Swing.It displays a barchart with 3D
effect and drawn background. It is created in Java Swing you 
can add it as a JComponent to an existing gui in Java or you can 
include it into your website as an Applet. The Bars and the Chart 
itself can be tailored to the specific needs

I have included some sample php code with the required dependencies.
Should work if you copy everything from the project folder to your
server.

Although it kicked off as an assignment so I was restricted in 
using "special" things like alpha blending. I decided to boost it
up a bit and made a couple of changes will update soon.

//  If there is interest shown I am thinking of the following:	//
//  # Splitting up code to be easier to comprehend		//
//  # Proper dynamic zoom and unit control			//
//  # Export to jpeg what you can include as an image stream	//
//  # Some basic nice smooth animation perhaps			//
//  # Migrating the code to PHP					//

~ It's a pity the Applets didn't become widespread on the web so 
I probably won't improve that :(

A 3D Barchart written in Java Swing.It displays a barchart with 3D
effect and drawn background. It is created in Java Swing you 
can add it as a JComponent to an existing gui in Java or you can 
include it into your website as an Applet.

I have included some sample php code with the required dependencies.
Should work if you copy everything from the project folder to your
server.

Although it kicked off as an assignment so I was restricted in 
using "special" things like alpha blending. I decided to boost it
up a bit and made a couple of changes will update soon.

//  If there is interest shown I am thinking of the following:	//
//  # Splitting up code to be easier to comprehend		//
//  # Proper dynamic zoom and unit control			//
//  # Export to jpeg what you can include as an image stream	//
//  # Some basic nice smooth animation perhaps			//
//  # Migrating the code to PHP					//

~ It's a pity the Applets didn't become widespread on the web so 
I probably won't improve that :(

The Bars and the Chart itself can be tailored to the specific needs
by using meaningful private instance variables. 

	//Bars
	//////
	/**Proportion in pixels representing 1 unit*/
	private static final int	barProport = 1;

	/**Proportion in pixels representing 1 unit*/
	private int	barUnit;

	private int	adjust;

	/**Width of the Bar*/
	private static final int barWidth = 30;

	/**Gap between bars including barWidth*/
	private static final int	gapBars = 30;

	/** Diagonal Edge in 3D*/
	private static final int dia = 10;

	//Chart
	///////
	/** Gap between active Area and edge of Frame */
	private static final int edge = 40;

	/** Gap between Edge of the Frame and 1st Bar */
	private static final int gap1stBar = 85;

	//Color Constants
	/////////////////
	/** Color of edge of the bar */
	private static final Color edgeBar = new Color(0,0,0);

	/** Color of background of the Chart */
	private static final Color bgChart = new Color(245,222,179);

	/** Color of background of the Chart */
	private static final Color fontChart = new Color(0,0,0);

	/** Color of background of the Chart */
	private static final Color lineChart = new Color(0,0,0);

	/** Color of Scales on Chart */
	private static final Color scalesChart = new Color(90,90,90);

	/** Color Difference between Sides of Bar */ 
	private static final int diff = 30;

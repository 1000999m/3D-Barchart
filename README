A 3D Barchart written in Java Swing.

It displays a barchart with 3D effect and drawn background. It is created in Java Swing you 
can add it as a JComponent to an existing gui in Java or you can include it into your website as an Applet.

I have included some sample php code with the required dependencies. Should work if you copy 
everything from the project folder to your server.

There are a few screenshots attached, any questions, feel free to post.


The Bars and the Chart itself can be tailored to the specific needs by using meaningful private instance variables. 

  //Bars
  //////
	/**Proportion in pixels representing 1 unit*/
	private static final int	barProport = 1;

	/**Proportion in pixels representing 1 unit*/
	private int	barUnit;

	private int	adjust;

	/**Width of the Bar*/
	private static final int barWidth = 30;

	/**Gap between bars including barWidth*/
	private static final int	gapBars = 30;

	/** Diagonal Edge in 3D*/
	private static final int dia = 10;

	//Chart
	///////
	/** Gap between active Area and edge of Frame */
	private static final int edge = 40;

	/** Gap between Edge of the Frame and 1st Bar */
	private static final int gap1stBar = 85;

	//Color Constants
	/////////////////
	/** Color of edge of the bar */
	private static final Color edgeBar = new Color(0,0,0);

	/** Color of background of the Chart */
	private static final Color bgChart = new Color(245,222,179);

	/** Color of background of the Chart */
	private static final Color fontChart = new Color(0,0,0);

	/** Color of background of the Chart */
	private static final Color lineChart = new Color(0,0,0);

	/** Color of Scales on Chart */
	private static final Color scalesChart = new Color(90,90,90);

	/** Color Difference between Sides of Bar */ 
	private static final int diff = 30;
